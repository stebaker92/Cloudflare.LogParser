# Cloudflare.LogParser
A basic console app to parse / query cloudflare logs

Cloudflares API doesn't support much / any filtering of requests, so this app allows you to filter by multiple options (such as host & route).

A breakdown of requests is also displayed with information such as average request time, a count of successful and failed requests and a status code breakdown.
